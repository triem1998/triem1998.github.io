  abstract={Automatic identification and quantification of gamma-emitting radionuclides, taking into account spectral deformations due to gamma-interactions in radioactive source surroundings, is a challenging task in the nuclear field. In that context, this paper presents a Machine Learning approach based on autoencoder that can learn a model for the spectral signatures of gamma-emitters with variability. Training and test datasets were obtained by means of simulated gamma-spectra computed with the Geant4 simulation code according to increasing material thicknesses (steel, lead). A novel hybrid unmixing algorithm combining a pretrained autoencoder is studied for joint estimation of spectral signatures and counting in the case of mixtures of four radionuclides Co-57, Co-60, Ba-133, Cs-137). The investigations were carried out to account for spectral deformations due to attenuation, Compton scattering and fluorescence at high and low statistics. This study demonstrates the validity of this novel hybrid approach combining Machine Learning and Maximum Likelihood for the automatic full-spectrum analysis of gamma-spectra.},

  abstract={The automatic identification and quantification of gamma-emitting radionuclides, accounting for spectral deformation due to gamma interactions in the environment of radioactive sources, is a challenge for various nuclear applications. In this paper, this problem is addressed by developing a hybrid approach combining Machine Learning and classical statistical methods. A specific Machine Learning-based autoencoder that can capture spectral variability with limited data is proposed. A novel hybrid unmixing algorithm employing a pre-trained autoencoder is investigated for joint estimation of spectral signatures and counting in the case of mixtures of four radionuclides Co-57, Co-60, Ba-133, Cs-137). This study was carried out to take account of spectral deformation due to attenuation and Compton scattering at low statistics.

abstract = {Automatic identification and quantification of γ-emitting radionuclides, considering the spectral deformation due to γ-interactions in the radioactive source environment, is a demanding challenge in the field of nuclear physics. In this context, this paper presents a hybrid unmixing approach combining a pre-trained machine learning model (autoencoder) to capture spectral deformations and a model selection technique based on statistical testing to identify the radionuclides present in a radioactive source and quantify their mixing weights. The identification process of radionuclides is based on a sequential selection algorithm using a likelihood ratio test depending on the expected false positives. Basically, this method aims to minimize the number of radionuclides in an initial radionuclide library containing characteristic γ-spectra of each γ-emitter to be tested. The robustness of decision-making with this approach and the quantification performance are investigated with Monte Carlo simulations involving up to 12 radionuclides to be tested, according to different mixture scenarios with increasing complexity and various statistics. The false positive rates obtained with the hybrid unmixing approach are close to the expected values. In general, the quantification results are similar to the case when the radionuclides present in the source and spectral signatures are known. This highlights the effectiveness of this novel hybrid unmixing approach for the automatic identification and quantification of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides with spectral variability.},
