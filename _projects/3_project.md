    <h1 id="context">Context</h1>
    <p>Gamma-ray spectrometry is a traditional technique widely used in various nuclear applications. My PhD research focuses on developing a novel approach to account for spectral variability in gamma-ray spectrometry. A measured gamma-ray spectrum can be modeled as a Poisson distribution of linear combinations of the spectral signatures of individual radionuclides. However, in practical applications, these spectral signatures can be deformed by physical phenomena, making them unknown. My thesis aims to identify and quantify the radionuclides present in a radioactive source from a single spectrum measured with a reference library.</p>

    <h2 id="iae">Interpolating autoencoder (IAE)</h2>
       <p><b>Dataset:</b> Spectral signatures with variability for all radionuclides are generated by Geant4 -a general MC tool for the simulation of passage of particles through the matter. </p>

    <p><b>Key idea:</b> The IAE is composed of an extra component that performs linear interpolation from so-called anchor points in the latent domain. The advantage of the IAE is that it constrains the samples to be described as interpolants of anchor points that are known to be onto the physical manifold that describes the deformations of the spectral signatures. This additional constraint has been shown to enable efficient learning of the IAE, particularly in cases where the learning samples are limited, as in this study (less than 100 spectral signatures per radionuclide). <br>

    <h2 id="quan">Quantification: Spectral unmixing</h2>
    <p>The IAE models have been included in an unmixing procedure to jointly estimate the spectral signatures and mixing weight of all radionuclides from a single observed spectrum. To achieve this, a hybrid unmixing algorithm SEMSUN has been developed, combining the pretrained IAE model with a Maximum Likelihood Estimator. This approach is based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm.<br>

    <h2 id="iden">Identification: Model selection</h2>
	
    <p>The hybrid spectral unmixing SEMSUN has been combined with the selection model technique to identify the radionuclide present in a radioactive source from the reference library. The identification process of radionuclides is based on a sequential selection algorithm using a likelihood ratio test depending on the expected false positives. Basically, this method aims to minimize the number of radionuclides in an initial radionuclide library containing characteristic gamma-spectra of each gamma-emitter to be tested.<br>

 <h2 id="uq">Uncertainty quantification</h2>
	
    <p> The result of a hybrid unmixing algorithm is the maximum a posteriori (MAP) in the Bayesian framework. To quantify the uncertainty in the latent variables and mixing weights, two Bayesian methods have been explored: Laplace Approximation (LA) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

The LA method approximates the posterior distribution as a Gaussian, with the mean provided by the hybrid unmixing algorithm SEMSUN and the standard deviation derived from the Fisher matrix. In contrast, the MCMC approach employs the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)—an extension of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm—to sample from the posterior distribution. While the LA method is computationally efficient, the MCMC method offers more robust results when constraints strongly influence the distribution, though at a higher computational cost. Additionally, a user guide is provided to help efficiently apply these uncertainty quantification methods for spectral unmixing in gamma-ray spectrometry. <br>

 <p> The hybrid approach is evaluated against the state-of-the-art end-to-end CNN for identification and quantification tasks across various scenarios. <b>  This method outperforms the CNN in all scenarios for both tasks.</b> <br>
