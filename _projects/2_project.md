    <h1 id="context">Context</h1>
    <p>This M2 internship at Solvay, located in Lyon, France, focused on predicting chemical product properties using machine learning techniques. The project involved a multi-output regression problem with four output dimensions. Due to confidentiality agreements, the names of the products, features, associated code, and data cannot be disclosed.</p>

    <h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
    
        
    <p> The process started with data cleaning and exploratory visualization, including principal component analysis (PCA). Given the small dataset (~1000 samples), various traditional machine learning algorithms were explored: Elastic Net, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), KNN, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

</p>

<p> Two specific methods for multi-output regression were implemented in Python: multi-target regressor stacking and  Regressor chains. A nested cross-validation approach was employed to ensure robust evaluation, accompanied by hyperparameter tuning for all models. </p>

    <h1 id="results">Results</h1>
    <p>SVM, combined with stacking and regressor chains, yielded predictions closely matching the expected outputs. These results met the companyâ€™s expectations, leading to the proposal of a follow-up thesis to further investigate and expand on the project outcomes.
