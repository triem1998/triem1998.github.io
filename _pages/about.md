I am currently a PhD candidate at CEA, working on the application of machine learning for gamma-ray spectrometry.

My research focuses on developing a hybrid machine learning approach that combines machine learning techniques to model spectral variability with statistical methods that account for physical properties. In particular, I am investigating a new type of machine learning model: the interpolating autoencoder.

I am especially interested in leveraging recent advancements in artificial intelligence and developing innovative methodologies that can be applied across a wide range of scientific applications. I am also passionate about emerging technologies, such as transformers, diffusion models, and large language models (LLMs), and I stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

I hold a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from INSA Toulouse, where my interest in machine learning grew significantly. During my studies, I completed internships at Solvay and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), where I applied machine learning to solve real-world challenges.
